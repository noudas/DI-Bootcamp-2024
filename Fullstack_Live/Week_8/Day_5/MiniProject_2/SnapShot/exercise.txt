Snap Shot is a gallery created using React and React Router.
The Routes need to be setup for four default pages and a search page.
The images are displayed using an Image API, you could use the Pexel API
Sign in to Pexel, receive an API KEY and start making requests.

The functionalities
The user can search for a specific image type. As soon as the user click on the button, you will display 30 images corresponding to the category.
The user can also click on one of the 4 categories that you present on the page. In the demo the categories are Mountain,Beaches,Birds and Food but fell free to add your own personal categories.
When the user hovers on a image, add some nice CSS transitions.

Bonus: Add some kind of pagination, so on a click of a button, the user will be able to change the number of images displayed on the page.
Good luck!
