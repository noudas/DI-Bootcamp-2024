In this puzzle you have to go through all the SQL queries and provide us the output of the requests before executing them (ie. make an assumption).
Then, execute them to make sure you were correct.


Queries

CREATE TABLE FirstTab (
     id integer, 
     name VARCHAR(10)
)

INSERT INTO FirstTab VALUES
(5,'Pawan'),
(6,'Sharlee'),
(7,'Krish'),
(NULL,'Avtaar')

SELECT * FROM FirstTab

CREATE TABLE SecondTab (
    id integer 
)

INSERT INTO SecondTab VALUES
(5),
(NULL)


SELECT * FROM SecondTab


DATA
Table1 – FirstTab
ID  Name
5   Pawan
6   Sharlee
7   Krish
NULL    Avtaar


Table2 – SecondTab
ID
5
NULL


Questions
Q1. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NULL )


A1. This will make a count of all ids from the SecondTab that are null, 
    which will return 0 because no rows from FirstTab will satisfy the condition due to the presence of NULL in the subquery.

Correction:
A1 OUTPUT: 0


Q2. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id = 5 )

A2. This will make a count of all ids that are not in SecondTab,
    which will return 2 due to excluding the id of 5 and the exclusion of the NULL row.


Correction:
A2 OUTPUT: 2



Q3. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab )

A3. The output of the query will be 2, because only the rows with id = 6 and id = 7 satisfy the condition. 
    Rows with id = 5 and NULL are excluded due to the behavior of NOT IN with NULL.


Correction:
A3 OUTPUT: 0

The output of this query will be 0. 
The presence of NULL in the subquery causes the condition to fail for all rows in FirstTab, as NOT IN with a NULL in the result set leads to UNKNOWN for all comparisons.



Q4. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NOT NULL )

A4. The output of the query will be 2 because only the rows with id = 6 and id = 7 are counted. 
    Row 5 is excluded, and the NULL row is excluded as well due to the NOT IN condition

Correction:
A4 OUTPUT: 2
