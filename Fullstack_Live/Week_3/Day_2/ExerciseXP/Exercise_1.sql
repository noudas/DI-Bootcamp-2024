/*
Exercise 1

We will work on the public database that we created yesterday.

Use SQL to get the following from the database:

	All items, ordered by price (lowest to highest).
	
	Items with a price above 80 (80 included), ordered by price (highest to lowest).
	
	The first 3 customers in alphabetical order of the first name (A-Z) â€“ 
	exclude the primary key column from the results.
	
	All last names (no other columns!), in reverse alphabetical order (Z-A)
*/

SELECT * FROM items ORDER BY price_item ASC;

SELECT * FROM items WHERE price_item >= 80 ORDER BY price_item ASC;

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM customers ORDER BY first_name ASC;

SELECT last_name FROM customers ORDER BY last_name DESC;
