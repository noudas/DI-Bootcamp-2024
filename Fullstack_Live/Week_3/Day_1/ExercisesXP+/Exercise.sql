Create a database called bootcamp.
Create a table called students.
Add the following columns:
id
last_name
first_name
birth_date
The id must be auto_incremented.
Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.
To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?)
