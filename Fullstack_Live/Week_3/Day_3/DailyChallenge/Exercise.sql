/*
Part I

Create 2 tables : Customer and Customer profile. They have a One to One relationship.

A customer can have only one profile, and a profile belongs to only one customer
The Customer table should have the columns : id, first_name, last_name NOT NULL
The Customer profile table should have the columns : id, isLoggedIn DEFAULT false (a Boolean), customer_id (a reference to the Customer table)


-- CREATE TABLE customer(
-- customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
-- first_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
-- last_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL
-- );

-- CREATE TABLE customer_profile(
-- customer_profile_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
-- isLoggedIn BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
-- customer_id INT REFERENCES customer(customer_id)
-- );


Insert those customers

John, Doe
Jerome, Lalu
Lea, Rive


-- INSERT INTO customer (first_name, last_name) 
-- VALUES 
-- ('John', 'Doe'),
-- ('Jerome', 'Lalu'),
-- ('Lea', 'Rive');

Insert those customer profiles, use subqueries

John is loggedIn
Jerome is not logged in

-- INSERT INTO customer_profile (isLoggedIn,customer_id)
-- VALUES 
-- (TRUE, (SELECT customer.customer_id FROM customer WHERE customer.customer_id = 1)),
-- (FALSE, (SELECT customer.customer_id FROM customer WHERE customer.customer_id = 2))


Use the relevant types of Joins to display:

The first_name of the LoggedIn customers
-- SELECT customer.first_name FROM customer
-- LEFT JOIN customer_profile
-- ON customer.customer_id = customer_profile.customer_id
-- WHERE customer_profile.isloggedin IS NOT FALSE



All the customers first_name and isLoggedIn columns - even the customers those who donâ€™t have a profile.

-- SELECT customer.first_name, COALESCE(customer_profile.isLoggedIn, FALSE) AS isLoggedIn
-- FROM customer
-- LEFT JOIN customer_profile
-- ON customer.customer_id = customer_profile.customer_id;



The number of customers that are not LoggedIn

-- SELECT COUNT(*) AS not_logged_in_count
-- FROM customer
-- LEFT JOIN customer_profile
-- ON customer.customer_id = customer_profile.customer_id
-- WHERE customer_profile.isLoggedIn IS FALSE OR customer_profile.isLoggedIn IS NULL;
*/


/*
Part II:

Create a table named Book, with the columns : 
book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
title NOT NULL, 
author NOT NULL

Insert those books :
Alice In Wonderland, Lewis Carroll
Harry Potter, J.K Rowling
To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee


CREATE TABLE book(
book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
title VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL, 
author VARCHAR(30)NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO book (title, author) 
VALUES 
('Alice In Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll'),
('Harry Potter', 'J.K Rowling'),
('To kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee');


Create a table named Student, with the columns : 
student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
name NOT NULL UNIQUE, age. Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);

Insert those students:
John, 12
Lera, 11
Patrick, 10
Bob, 14

CREATE TABLE student(
student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
age INT CHECK(age <= 15)
);

INSERT INTO student (name, age)
VALUES 
('John', 12),
('Lera', 11),
('Patrick', 10),
('Bob', 14)


Create a table named Library, with the columns :
book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
borrowed_date

This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables : 
A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children

book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table

The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table


CREATE TABLE library(
	book_fk_id INT,
	student_id INT,
	borrowed_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	PRIMARY KEY(book_fk_id,student_id),
	FOREIGN KEY(book_fk_id)
		REFERENCES book(book_id)
		ON DELETE CASCADE 
		ON UPDATE CASCADE,
	FOREIGN KEY(student_id)
		REFERENCES student(student_id)
		ON DELETE CASCADE 
		ON UPDATE CASCADE
)




Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021




INSERT INTO library (book_fk_id, student_id, borrowed_date)
VALUES 
    (
        (SELECT book.book_id FROM book WHERE title = 'Alice In Wonderland'),
        (SELECT student.student_id FROM student WHERE name = 'John'),
        '2022-02-15 00:00:00'
    ),
    (
        (SELECT book.book_id FROM book WHERE title = 'To kill a mockingbird'),
        (SELECT student.student_id FROM student WHERE name = 'Bob'),
        '2021-03-03 00:00:00'
    ),
    (
        (SELECT book.book_id FROM book WHERE title = 'Alice In Wonderland'),
        (SELECT student.student_id FROM student WHERE name = 'Lera'),
        '2021-05-23 00:00:00'
    ),
    (
        (SELECT book.book_id FROM book WHERE title = 'Harry Potter'),
        (SELECT student.student_id FROM student WHERE name = 'Bob'),
        '2021-08-12 00:00:00'
    );


Display the data
Select all the columns from the junction table
-- SELECT * FROM library;

Select the name of the student and the title of the borrowed books
-- SELECT 
--     student.name AS student_name,
--     book.title AS book_title
-- FROM library
-- JOIN student ON library.student_id = student.student_id
-- JOIN book ON library.book_fk_id = book.book_id;

Select the average age of the children, that borrowed the book Alice in Wonderland
-- SELECT 
--     AVG(student.age) AS average_age
-- FROM library
-- JOIN student ON library.student_id = student.student_id
-- JOIN book ON library.book_fk_id = book.book_id
-- WHERE book.title = 'Alice In Wonderland';



Delete a student from the Student table, what happened in the junction table ?
-- DELETE FROM student WHERE name = 'Bob';
Bob's borrowed books will no longer be associated with any student in the library table.
