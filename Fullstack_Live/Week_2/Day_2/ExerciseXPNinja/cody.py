# These are the rules of the Game of Life (as stated in Wikipedia):
# 
# The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, 
# each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively).
# 
# Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 
# At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
# 
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

# Using these rules, implement the Game. (Hint: use Classes !!!!)
# Use a few different initial states to see how the game ends.
# 
# Notes:
# 
# Display the grid after each generation
# The end of the game is fully determined by the initial state. So have it pass through your program and see how it ends.
# Be creative, but use classes
# The game can have fixed borders and can also have moving borders. First implement the fixed borders. Each “live” cell that is going out of the border, exits the game.
# Bonus: Make the game with ever expandable borders, make the maximum border size a very large number(10,000) so you won’t cause a memory overflow
