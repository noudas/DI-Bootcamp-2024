// Instructions
// Youâ€™re tasked with building a RESTful API for a blog platform.
// Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete blog posts using different endpoints.

// Create a directory named blog-api.
// Inside the blog-api directory, open a terminal and run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. 
// Follow the prompts to set up your project.
// Install the express package by running npm install express in the terminal.
// Create a file named server.js.


// Create a data array to simulate a database. 
// Each item in the array should represent a blog post with properties like id, title, and content.


// Implement the following routes using Express:
// GET /posts: Return a list of all blog posts.
// GET /posts/:id: Return a specific blog post based on its id.
// POST /posts: Create a new blog post.
// PUT /posts/:id: Update an existing blog post.
// DELETE /posts/:id: Delete a blog post.

// Implement error handling for invalid routes and server errors.

// Start the Express app and listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000).
