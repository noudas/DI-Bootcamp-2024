// Create a form like the one above. The form should contain three inputs:
// a small text input asking for a name,
// a larger textarea input to write a message,
// a submit input (“Send”)

// When you click the Send button, the form will be submitted with a GET method. (you can use the same HTML file for the action url)
// Where will the sent data appear?
// Nowhere because there is no server, but it will be stored at the end of the URL as URL parameters, appended as a query string.
