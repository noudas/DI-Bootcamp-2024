// Use the same form structure as Exercise 1.
// When you click the Send button, the form will be submitted with a POST method.(you can use the same HTML file for the action url)
// Where will the sent data appear? Hint : Look at the Network Tab

// Nowhere because there is no server. Unlike a GET request, the data will not appear in the URL as query parameters 
// but will be sent in the request body. 
// You can inspect this data in the Network tab of the browser's developer tools.
